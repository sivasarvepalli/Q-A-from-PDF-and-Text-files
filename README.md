Q&A system from PDF and text files. The application provides a user-friendly interface using the Streamlit framework, allowing users to interact with the Q&A functionality seamlessly.The uploaded file is analysed and answers are povided for the asked quation from the file. 

In this we have 2 sections, one is pdf analyser using openai API Key and other is text documents analyser using an API Key from Hugging Face Transformers which is a pre-trained Q&A system.

## Problem Statement
problem  : To study the whole pdf or text file is timne taking process. While it is good to resd the whole pdf and text files but it also consumes a lot of time when preparing for exams and when quick 
information is required it is hard to go through the whole document.

## About the Project

solution : By using this application, questions asked by the user will be answered from the pdf or the text file.  
we can simply say this is a student assistant.
Primary goal of this project is to assist the students for time efficient preparation.
This project mainly helps students to travers the pdf and text files in short time.
It uses openAI API KEY with which it reads the pdf files and answer the questions asked.
simple user interface.

## Technical implementation
- A pdf or Text file is taken as input.

- The text in the files is divided into fragments and anylsied.
  
- Then the user asks a quation & the model analysies the quation and finds the similer words from the Q and writes a Anawer.
